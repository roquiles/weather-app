# Weather App

Got the idea from [here](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/1-Beginner/Weather-App.md)

A weather application to get the temperature, weather condition and whether it is day or night of a particular city using `accuweather`.

## User Stories

- [ ] Enter the name of a city into the `input` field.
- [ ] By pressing enter, the user submits the name of the city which updates the `DOM` with the temperature, weather condition, image of day or night and weather condition icon.

## Bonus features

- [ ] By closing the browser window the city name will be stored in localStorage and when the user returns, the name will be retrieved to make an api call to update the `DOM`.
- [ ] User can see the weather forecast for the next four days.
